            <p>I am currently pursuing a post-graduate degree in Digital Experience Design at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon, having previously obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in Multimedia Art from the same faculty. <br>My focus is designing and creating outstanding digital experiences that solve <strong>real-world problems</strong> and enhance people's lives. I take a human-centered approach to my work, always keeping usability and business goals in mind. With my skills, I aim to combine motion and digital design through <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong>.</p>
            <p>Beyond design and motion, I am also passionate about travel, cinema, art books, and music. As a creative, I strive to live life to the fullest, embracing new experiences and seeking inspiration from the world around me.</p>
